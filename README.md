Based on your uploaded project `skillforge-main.zip`, here’s a clean and professional `README.md` **text** describing your UI-only website:

```
# SkillForge

SkillForge is a frontend-only web application that allows students to form learning groups based on their individual skill sets. The UI is designed to be minimal, responsive, and student-focused, providing a modern experience for peer-to-peer collaboration.

## Project Overview

This project was built as a UI prototype for a platform where students can:

- Register or sign in to the platform
- View or create learning groups
- Match with peers based on shared or complementary skills
- Explore a community-driven learning environment

## Features

- Responsive design with modern layout
- Clean and simple homepage
- User authentication UI (static only)
- Skill-based group formation concept UI
- Fully built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No backend logic)

## Folder Structure

```

skillforge/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── login.html
├── signup.html
├── styles/
│   └── style.css
├── scripts/
│   └── app.js
└── assets/
└── images, icons, etc.

```

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` with any modern browser.
3. Navigate through the static pages to explore the UI flow.

## Note

This is a **UI-only prototype**. No backend functionality (authentication, data storage, real-time matching, etc.) has been implemented.

## Future Scope

- Add backend integration for user management and group logic
- Implement real-time matchmaking using skills
- Add database and authentication services
